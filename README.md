Welcome to My Yoga Timer!

Ever been in the right meditation mindset, so you jump in to a sesssion, then realize you don't know exactly how long it has been? 

Sure you can run a clock, but with this app, you'll be also able to receive notifications for you schedule yoga sessions and immediately start a clock, and record that session in memory with accurate timing. 

Perfect for someone doing teacher training working and needs to record their hours, or anyone who wants to make sure they don't overexert themselves. 

Log in via facebook will be easy, too.

Ok, instructions for usage now:

1.) fork and clone. if you're here on github, im going to assume your familiar with that...
2.) open a command terminal and cd into the project
3.) run rails db:create, then :migrate, then :seed
4.) run rails s, and navigate to localhost:3001 in chrome
5.) Yah cool the api is open and running, now we'll have to go start our React front end
